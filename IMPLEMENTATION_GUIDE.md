# Claude Code Implementation Guide

## Overview

The 1,160-line implementation guide has been broken down into focused, manageable documents for better usability. This main guide now serves as a navigation hub to the specialized guides.

## Quick Installation

Use the correct installation command:
```bash
# Install framework to target project
./install-claude-framework.sh /path/to/target/project

# OR use the deployment wrapper
./deploy-to-project.sh /path/to/target/project
```

**‚úÖ CLAUDE.md Protection**: The installation script correctly places framework documentation in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and does NOT overwrite existing project root CLAUDE.md files.

## Quick Commands

### Installation Commands
```bash
# Install to current directory
./install-claude-framework.sh .

# Install to specific project
./install-claude-framework.sh /path/to/my/project

# Deploy with setup
./deploy-to-project.sh /path/to/my/project
```

### Post-Installation

# Activate framework
source ./scripts/activate.sh

# Check status
claude-status

# Start coordination (with Expert system)
claude-coordinator start-with-fallback
```

## Migration from Large File

The original 1,160-line IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md has been restructured into focused guides. Each guide covers a specific aspect of the Claude workflow framework:

1. **Quick Start** - Get up and running fast
2. **Configurations** - Project-specific setup templates  
3. **Coordination** - Multi-agent coordination setup
4. **Verification** - Work completion verification
5. **Monitoring** - Metrics and performance tracking

This modular approach improves:
- ‚úÖ **Findability** - Easier to locate specific information
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability** - Simpler to update individual components
- ‚úÖ **Usability** - Focused content for specific tasks
- ‚úÖ **Loading Speed** - Smaller files load faster
