Transform your Claude Code development from single-instance limitations to coordinated multi-agent workflows with Expert Knowledge Base integration. workflow-ng eliminates race conditions, prevents duplicate work, and enables seamless collaboration between multiple Claude Code instances with real-time access to 85,000+ expert knowledge chunks across 73 specialized domains.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/forrest321/workflow-ng.git
cd workflow-ng

# Install in your project (safe - preserves existing CLAUDE.md)
./install-framework.sh /path/to/your/project

# Activate framework in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
source .claude/scripts/activate.sh

# Start Expert-enhanced coordination (recommended)
claude-coordinator start-with-fallback

# Or start Redis services manually
docker-compose -f docker-compose.coordination.yml up -d
```

### Expert Knowledge Base Quick Test
```bash
# Check Expert system status
claude-coordinator expert-status
