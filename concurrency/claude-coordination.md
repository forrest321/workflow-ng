# Claude AI Agent Coordination in Distributed Systems

## Architecture Overview

### Claude Code Agent Model
- Claude Code operates as an agentic tool for terminal-based development
- Enables autonomous task execution: code migrations, bug fixes, feature development
- Supports complex problem reasoning and collaborative planning

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Open protocol standard for unified context interaction
- Streamable HTTP transport with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Provides bidirectional communication for distributed systems

## Work Claiming Mechanisms

### Current File-Based Limitations
- Work claimed by writing to files
- Status not kept current leads to duplicate work
- Race conditions between Claude Code instances
- Need migration to high-throughput systems (Redis)

### Recommended Improvements
- **Atomic Work Claims**: Use distributed locks with TTL
- **Heartbeat Mechanisms**: Regular status updates to maintain claim validity
- **Queue-Based Distribution**: FIFO/priority queues for fair work allocation
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time coordination between instances

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Task Distribution Patterns
- **Hierarchical Planning**: Central planner breaks down complex tasks
- **Subagent Management**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic assignment based on availability and capability

### Coordination Strategies
- **Centralized Control**: Single agent maintains global state
- **Distributed Consensus**: Gossip protocols and consensus algorithms
- **Market-Based Allocation**: Competitive bidding for resource allocation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Enhanced Service Dependency Management
- **Auto-Start Infrastructure**: First worker detects missing Redis/Docker and attempts startup
- **User-Controlled Fallback**: Fall back to file-based coordination only with explicit user consent
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous service health checks with automatic recovery
- **Clear User Guidance**: Detailed error messages and fallback options when manual intervention required

### For File-Based Systems (Current)
- Implement file locking with timeout mechanisms
- Use atomic operations for claim updates
- Add timestamp validation for claim expiry
- **Orphaned Work Recovery**: Periodic scan for abandoned work with automatic reassignment

### For Distributed Systems (Target)
- Redis-based work queues with pub/sub notifications
- Consistent hashing for work distribution
- Circuit breakers for failed worker detection
- **Orphan Detection**: Redis-based monitoring for stale claims with automatic cleanup

### Risk Mitigation
- Sandbox tool access for security
- Audit trails for work assignment and completion
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- **Work Resurrection**: Failed early-stage work automatically returned to queue
- **Failure Classification**: Distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable failures
