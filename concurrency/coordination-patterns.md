# AI Workflow Concurrency Coordination Patterns

## Core Patterns for Automated Workers

### Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern
- Execute multiple tasks simultaneously across potentially multiple workers
- Wait for completion and perform aggregation on results
- Useful for parallel processing of independent work units

### Event-Based Coordination
- Emit multiple events to trigger parallel execution
- Use `collect_events` methods to wait for multiple completion signals
- Enables loose coupling between workflow components

### Worker Pool Management
- Configure worker pools with specified concurrency limits (e.g., `num_workers=4`)
- Distribute workload across available workers
- Balance resource utilization with throughput requirements

## Race Condition Prevention

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**: Provides exclusive access to shared resources
- **Atomic Operations**: Guaranteed execution without interruption
- **Reader-Writer Locks**: Allow multiple readers or single writer access

### Concurrency Control Strategies
- Disable concurrent execution for resource-sensitive operations
- Implement proper locking mechanisms for shared state
- Use well-established concurrency patterns and idioms

### AI-Specific Considerations
- Adaptive and self-learning workflow systems
- Real-time optimization based on data and feedback
- Orchestration layer management for complex LLM interactions
- Memory management across multiple AI model calls

## Implementation Guidelines
- Prefer event-driven architectures for loose coupling
- Implement backpressure mechanisms for high-throughput scenarios
- Use distributed coordination systems (Redis, etcd) for scalability
- Monitor and adjust concurrency levels based on performance metrics
