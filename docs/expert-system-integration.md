curl -s "http://localhost:8080/health"

# Check system stats
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/index/stats" | jq .

# Only start if connection fails
cd /Users/fo/Documents/code/experts/vector-knowledge-base
./bin/server &

- Warning messages indicate Expert guidance is unavailable
- Fallback to general best practices

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate `top_k` values (5-20 typically sufficient)
- Cache frequently used results when possible
- Monitor system performance via monitoring dashboard

### Query Optimization
- Use specific, technical queries for better results
- Include technology names and specific concepts
- Combine related terms for comprehensive results
- Use domain filtering for targeted guidance

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation
- Be specific about technology stack and context
- Include relevant domain terms
- Specify the type of guidance needed (implementation, testing, deployment)

### 2. Result Processing
- Parse JSON responses to extract relevant content
- Check relevance scores (higher = more relevant)
- Combine multiple Expert responses for comprehensive guidance

### 3. Workflow Integration
- Start each phase with Expert consultation
- Use Expert guidance to inform task breakdown
- Cache Expert recommendations for reuse
- Document Expert-guided decisions

## Future Enhancements
