# Task Coordination and Management Framework

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for AI Workflows

### Hierarchical Task Decomposition
- **Project Goals**: Top-level objectives and success criteria
- **Major Deliverables**: Primary components and milestones
- **Work Packages**: Smaller, manageable task units
- **Individual Tasks**: Atomic work items assignable to agents

### Task Categorization
- **Planning Tasks**: Architecture design, requirement analysis, scheduling
- **Execution Tasks**: Code development, testing, deployment activities
- **Monitoring Tasks**: Progress tracking, quality assurance, reporting
- **Coordination Tasks**: Inter-agent communication, dependency management

## Agile Task Management Integration

### Sprint-Based Planning
- **Sprint Goals**: Clear objectives for each iteration cycle
- **Task Estimation**: Effort estimation for automated and manual work
- **Velocity Tracking**: Monitor team and agent productivity over time
- **Retrospective Analysis**: Continuous improvement of processes

### Kanban Flow Management
- **Work Visualization**: Visual representation of task states and flow
- **Work-in-Progress Limits**: Prevent bottlenecks and resource overload
- **Continuous Delivery**: Steady flow of completed work items
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Early detection and resolution of blockers

## AI Agent Task Distribution

### Expert-Enhanced Orchestration Models
- **Centralized Control**: Single orchestrator assigns and manages all tasks with Expert guidance
- **Decentralized Coordination**: Agents communicate directly with access to Expert Knowledge Base
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines centralized planning with decentralized execution and Expert consultation
- **Market-Based Allocation**: Agents bid for tasks based on capability, availability, and Expert recommendations

### Intelligent Task Assignment
- **Expert-Guided Routing**: Match tasks to agents using Expert domain knowledge and capability analysis
- **Technology-Aware Balancing**: Distribute work based on technology stack expertise from Expert Knowledge Base
- **Priority Queuing**: Handle high-priority tasks with Expert-informed priority assessment
- **Dependency Resolution**: Ensure prerequisite tasks complete using Expert dependency guidance

## Expert-Enhanced Automated Workflow Orchestration

### Intelligent Workflow Patterns
- **Sequential Processing**: Tasks executed in linear order with Expert-guided dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks running simultaneously with Expert concurrency recommendations
- **Conditional Branching**: Task flow based on Expert-informed decision points
- **Event-Driven Triggers**: Tasks initiated by Expert-analyzed conditions and events

### Advanced Coordination Mechanisms
- **Expert-Informed Message Passing**: Asynchronous communication with context-aware Expert guidance
- **Knowledge-Enhanced State Management**: Centralized state enriched with Expert domain insights
- **Intelligent Event Streaming**: Real-time event propagation with Expert pattern recognition
- **Expert-Guided Callbacks**: Notification mechanisms enhanced with domain-specific recommendations

## Resource Management and Scheduling

### Capacity Planning
- **Agent Availability**: Track resource capacity and availability windows
- **Skill Inventory**: Maintain catalog of agent capabilities and expertise
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor throughput, quality, and efficiency
- **Scaling Policies**: Auto-scaling rules for demand fluctuations

### Scheduling Algorithms
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Execute high-priority tasks first
- **Deadline-Driven Scheduling**: Ensure time-sensitive tasks meet deadlines
- **Resource-Constrained Scheduling**: Optimize for limited resource availability
- **Dependency-Aware Scheduling**: Respect task interdependencies

## Quality Assurance and Monitoring

### Progress Tracking
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Visual representation of workflow status
- **Milestone Monitoring**: Track progress against key deliverables
- **Alert Systems**: Proactive notification of issues and delays
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed metrics on task execution and outcomes

### Risk Management
